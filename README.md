To build a basic HTTP server in Rust, hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on the concepts you should learn and implement:

### Step 1: **Understand HTTP Protocol Basics**

- Learn the structure of HTTP requests and responses.
  - Request: Methods (GET, POST), Headers, and Body.
  - Response: Status codes, Headers, and Body.
- Understand the difference between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 (focus on HTTP/1.1 for simplicity).

---

### Step 2: **Learn Rust Basics**

- Familiarize yourself with Rust's syntax, ownership model, and error handling.
- Key features: `match`, `Result`, `Option`, `struct`, and `enum`.

---

### Step 3: **Understand Networking in Rust**

- Learn about TCP/IP and how HTTP operates over TCP.
- Study Rust's `std::net` module:
  - `TcpListener` for accepting connections.
  - `TcpStream` for reading and writing data.

---

### Step 4: **Parse HTTP Requests**

- Learn to read raw data from a `TcpStream` and parse it into structured HTTP requests.
  - Use string operations to split request lines.
  - Parse headers and body.

---

### Step 5: **Construct HTTP Responses**

- Learn to construct valid HTTP responses:
  - Status lines (e.g., `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`).
  - Response headers (e.g., `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`).
  - Response body (e.g., HTML content).

---

### Step 6: **Handle Concurrency**

- Understand how to handle multiple connections:
  - Use threads: `std::thread::spawn`.
  - Explore `tokio` or `async-std` for asynchronous handling.
  - Learn about the Rust async/await model for more advanced handling.

---

### Step 7: **Serve Static Files**

- Implement functionality to read files from disk and serve them as HTTP responses.
- Handle common content types (e.g., `text/html`, `image/png`).

---

### Step 8: **Implement Routing**

- Add basic routing to your server:
  - Map specific request paths (e.g., `/hello`, `/about`) to different responses.

---

### Step 9: **Error Handling**

- Implement proper error handling:
  - Return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., `404 Not Found`, `500 Internal Server Error`).
  - Gracefully handle invalid HTTP requests.

---

### Step 10: **Refactor and Modularize**

- Refactor your code into reusable modules:
  - Parsing requests.
  - Constructing responses.
  - Handling routing.

---

### Step 11: **Extend Functionality (Optional)**

- Add logging for incoming requests.
- Add support for query parameters.
- Experiment with HTTPS using `rustls`.

---

### Tools and Libraries

- Start with Rust's standard library (`std::net`).
- Gradually explore libraries like `hyper`, `warp`, or `actix-web` once you're comfortable with the basics.
